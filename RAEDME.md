# VersaBlog Backend

The VersaBlog backend provides a robust, scalable API for managing user-generated blog content—including text and images—and serves data to external front-end applications. Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB Atlas, the backend leverages GraphQL for flexible data retrieval and supports API versioning and cloud storage for image uploads via AWS S3.

## Overview

This backend serves as the core engine for the VersaBlog platform. It manages blog posts—including text and images—and supports operations such as creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving posts. Key features include:
- **GraphQL API**: Provides a unified interface for clients to query or mutate data.
- **File Uploads to Cloud Storage**: Uses AWS S3 to handle image uploads efficiently.
- **API Versioning**: Ensures backward compatibility as the API evolves.
- **Centralized Error Handling & Logging**: Integrated with Winston (and optionally Sentry) to track errors and server activity.
- **Flexible Data Models**: Supports hierarchical categories, tags, and versatile post models.

## Features

- **Post Management**: Create, update, delete, and query blog posts.
- **Category and Tag Support**: Organize posts with hierarchical categories and tags.
- **File Uploads**: Secure image uploads to AWS S3 with robust error handling.
- **GraphQL API**: Empower clients with flexible queries and mutations.
- **API Versioning**: Manage API evolution without breaking existing clients.
- **Centralized Logging and Monitoring**: Track and debug issues efficiently.

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (with Mongoose)
- **API Layer**: GraphQL (using Apollo Server)
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 for image uploads
- **Logging**: Winston (with optional Sentry integration)
- **Versioning**: API versioning implemented via endpoint paths (e.g., `/graphql/v1`)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/versa-blog-backend.git
   cd versa-blog-backend

    Install Dependencies:

    npm install

## Configuration

    Environment Variables:

    Create a .env file in the project root with configuration similar to:

    # MongoDB Atlas connection
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/versa-blog?retryWrites=true&w=majority

    # AWS S3 Configuration
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    AWS_REGION=us-east-1
    AWS_S3_BUCKET=YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME

    # Server Port
    PORT=4000

    Additional Settings:

    Adjust settings for logging, error handling, or any other service integrations as needed.

## Usage

    Start the Server:

    Make sure your .env file is configured correctly, then run:

node server.js

Alternatively, if you use a process manager like nodemon, start the server with:

    nodemon server.js

    GraphQL Endpoint:

    The GraphQL API is available at http://localhost:4000/graphql/v1. Use Apollo Sandbox or GraphQL Playground to interact with the API.

    REST Endpoints:

    File uploads (e.g., for images) are available under versioned paths (for example, http://localhost:4000/api/v1/upload).

GraphQL API

The backend exposes a GraphQL API with endpoints designed for flexible data retrieval:
Example Queries

    Get Posts Summary:

query {
  postsSummary {
    totalPosts
    drafts
    published
    pending
  }
}

Get Recent Posts:

    query {
      recentPosts {
        id
        title
        publishedAt
      }
    }

Example Mutations

    Create a New Post:

mutation {
  createPost(title: "Example Post", content: "Content goes here...", slug: "example-post", status: "published") {
    id
    title
    publishedAt
  }
}

Create a New Category:

mutation {
  createCategory(name: "Faith & Spirituality", slug: "faith-spirituality", description: "Content related to bible studies, devotionals, and spiritual growth.") {
    id
    name
  }
}

Create a New Tag:

    mutation {
      createTag(name: "Inspiration") {
        id
        name
      }
    }

Deployment

For production deployment, consider the following:

    Containerization:
    Use Docker to containerize your backend for consistent deployment.

    Cloud Deployment:
    Deploy the backend to a cloud provider (AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean, etc.), ensuring secure configuration of environment variables and scaling options.

    Monitoring & Logging:
    Integrate advanced logging (Winston, optionally with Sentry) and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track application performance.
